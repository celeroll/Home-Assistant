## Install OSMC

Download image from [osmc.tv](http://osmc.tv) and install it with `osmc installer`.
- Wifi should be setup in the `osmc installer`
- SSH is activated on default. User: `osmc`, Pass: `osmc`

### Install Harmony remote / hub

This can be tricky. But the main idea is to add new harmony device, so that "bluetooth pairing" appear,  and OSMC can see the harmony keyboard as bluetooth device.
- Manufacturer: `Microsoft`
- Device: `Media Player`

After the whole pairing process, "old" activity should also work and new added  devices can be removed from harmony app.

---
Samba should be installed from `My OSMC` without problems.
